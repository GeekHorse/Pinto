The "compare" script takes all PNG image files in this directory and generates 3
other files for each img.png file:

 - img.png.b64
   The PNG image base64 encoded so it's a text format.
 - img.pinto
   The image in the Pinto format.
 - img.pinto.gz
   The pinto format gzip'd.

This way, we can compare img.png.b64 to img.pinto, which are both in a text
format, and img.png to img.pinto.gz, which are both in a binary format. It also
compares img.png to img.pinto, just to show that even the text Pinto format can
be smaller than the binary PNG format.

It also prints out a table showing the size differences.

You run it like this:
./compare > RESULTS.txt

The PNG images currently in this directory have been run through pngcrush to
make them as small as possible. If you want to add a new PNG image to this
directory to compare, you should run it through pngcrush with something like
this:
  pngcrush -q -rem allb -reduce -brute file file.crushed
  mv file.crushed file

NOTE: Pinto is not a PNG replacement. PNG and PINTO have different design goals,
and should be used for what they're individually good at. This "compare" script
is just to show how small Pinto can encode the types of images that it is good
at encoding.
