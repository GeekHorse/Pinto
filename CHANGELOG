Pinto Changelog:
	1.0.01
		2013-NOV-10
		Fixed off-by-one error in _testGoodDeflate().

		Got too excited and forgot to run tests through valgrind one last time
		before release. To help me not forget anything again, I created a
		"preReleaseChecks" script to automate all the checks I need to do before
		a release.
	1.0
		2013-NOV-03
		COMPLETED

	Pinto is considered finished. No more updates are planned. Only bug fixes
	will be committed.
