Pinto is considered finished. No more updates are planned.

Pinto Changelog:
	1.0.02
		2014-JAN-25

		Summary:
		- Added pintoImageDownsize() to create anti-aliased images.
		- Added pintoHookLog() function pointer that's used for logging errors.

		Details:
		- Added pintoImageDownsize() to create anti-aliased images from Pinto
		  images.
		- Added an rgbaDownsize option in pintoToRgba to create a half-size
		  anti-aliased image from a Pinto image.
		- Added some examples images that show double-size Pinto images are
		  still smaller than half-size PNG images.
		- Added a "blackOnly" option to rgbaToPinto to help when creating black
		  bitmapped fonts.
		- In utilities and test app, print usage to stderr instead of stdout.
		- Added new pintoHookLog() hook function that pinto uses to log errors.
		  This allows pinto to plug into an external log system.
		- Changed PARANOID_ERR_IF() checks to normal ERR_IF() checks for too
		  large widths or heights in pintoImageDecodeText(). Also added matching
		  tests. Too large widths or heights would have still been caught in
		  pintoImageInit(), but this improves code readability.
		- Removed PRECOND_ERR_IF() macro and replaced with normal ERR_IF()s.
		- Added macros ERR_IF_1() and friends so extra information can be
		  passed to the new pintoHookLog() logging function.
		- Changed PINTO_RC from enums to defines, and changed their values to be
		  globally unique against all my other libraries. This allows error
		  codes to be passed from library to library.
		- Added missing tests for some kinds of bad double and triple encoded
		  numbers.
		- Renamed PINTO_VERSION_BUGFIX to PINTO_VERSION_SUBMINOR.
		- Added PINTO_VERSION_FINAL that flags whether a version is still being
		  developed or if it's finished.
		- Updated copyright dates to 2014.

	1.0.01
		2013-NOV-10
		Fixed off-by-one error in _testGoodDeflate().

		Got too excited and forgot to run tests through valgrind one last time
		before release. To help me not forget anything again, I created a
		"preReleaseChecks" script to automate all the checks I need to do before
		a release.
